# ApplAi Internship Projects  

Welcome to my ApplAi Internship repository!  
This repo documents the Customer Segmentation data science project I completed during my internship using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.  

---

##  Project Overview  

| Title | Description | Techniques & Tools |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Customer Segmentation | Segment customers based on purchasing behavior | K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, Feature Scaling, Elbow Method, Pandas, Seaborn |

---

##  Tech Stack & Tools  

- Python — primary programming language  
- Pandas & NumPy — data manipulation and preprocessing  
- scikit-learn — clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) and evaluation metrics  
- Jupyter Notebooks — interactive experimentation  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn — visualization of data & insights  
- Streamlit — for building simple interactive dashboards  

---

##  Future Enhancements  

- Add interactive dashboards (e.g., using Plotly or Streamlit).  
- Conduct deeper statistical analysis and feature engineering.  
- Integrate more advanced models (e.g., Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models).  
- Deploy model or visualizations as a web application.

##  How to Run the Application  

1. Open your terminal (CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash).  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the following command:  

```bash
streamlit run app.py
